# flutterjourney

After playing around with flutter a bit, I thought why not log this journey while I gain my skill in flutter.

- I have played around with flutter a bit
    1. Setup flutter development environment on my machine. 
    2. Using VS Code as my primary IDE, I have also tried android studio but VS Code turns out to be a bit faster and easy on my machine, Android studio tends to heat up my mac a bit more. 
    3. I have learned basic concepts of flutter and UI Components. 
    4. I have learned about Stateful and Stateless widgets.
    5. Learned a bit about passing data between widgets through callback functions.
